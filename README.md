# 👋 Hi, I'm Diego Landa

**Principal / Staff-leaning Full-Stack Engineer (15+ yrs)** — **TypeScript, React/Next.js, Node (Fastify/Express), AWS**  
I build and modernize products across US, LATAM, and EU teams (incl. Sweden), with a focus on **platform/IAM**, **reliability**, and **developer velocity**.

---

## What I focus on

- **Platform & Identity:** authentication/session flows, IAM modules, access control (RBAC/ABAC) foundations
- **Full-stack TypeScript:** React/Next.js + Node + PostgreSQL
- **Reliability & observability:** tracing/metrics, error reporting, performance tuning
- **Testing & delivery:** BDD (Cucumber), E2E, CI/CD, release automation
- **AI-assisted workflows:** pragmatic LLM integration + local-first indexing/chat experiments

## Featured projects

### ✅ KeepMeHonest
A CLI/tooling project to keep implementation aligned with a plan (especially when working with AI coding assistants): small steps, clear checkpoints, less drift.

**Quickstart (canonical command):**
```bash
npx @mejor/keepmehonest@latest init
```

**Common follow-ups**
```bash
npx @mejor/keepmehonest@latest --help
# (If you installed it as a direct CLI binary)
kmh --help
```

> If your setup uses a different executable name, `--help` will show the available commands.

### 📰 Kudos Ideas Chronicles
A Victorian-newspaper style “chronicle” of modern software work: build logs, experiments, and lessons learned across full-stack systems, AI tooling, and engineering initiatives (including workshops, events, and templates/playbooks).

- Focus: **decisions + outcomes** (what worked, what didn’t, what I’d change)
- Topics: platform work, product iterations, developer experience, AI-assisted building
